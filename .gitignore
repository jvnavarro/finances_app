# Your specific data file (if you don't want to version it)
# dados.txt
# If you DO want to version 'dados.txt' from the 'bin/' directory,
# but ignore other executables in 'bin/', you can do this:
# bin/*
# !bin/dados.txt
# However, if 'dados.txt' is user-generated and changes often,
# you might prefer not to commit it. You have 'bin/dados.txt' in your main.cpp.
# For now, I'll assume you want to ignore the 'bin' directory which typically holds executables.
# If 'dados.txt' is meant to be a default/sample, keep it and adjust.
# If 'dados.txt' is truly user data, it's good to ignore it or have a strategy for it.

# If your dados.txt is specifically in a directory you want to otherwise ignore (like bin/)
# but you want to keep dados.txt, you can do this:
# bin/*
# !bin/dados.txt

# If your dados.txt is at the root, and you don't want to commit it:
# dados.txt
